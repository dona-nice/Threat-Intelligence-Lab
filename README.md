# Threat-Intelligence-Lab
In this project, I analyzed threat actor profiling as a key component of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) to understand attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The project focused on APT41, a known cyber threat group, and the SolarWinds attack, mapping their behaviors using the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework.
